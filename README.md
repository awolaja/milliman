## End-to-End Data Pipeline Overview

Below is the high-level flow of this notebook:

## Pipeline Documentation

This notebook implements an end-to-end pipeline to process clinical ccda files and claims data into a FHIR-compatible format:

1. Fetch c-CDA XML files from pre-signed S3 URLs.
2. Extract relevant domains (Medications, Problems) from each CCDA.
3. Join parsed data with claims data (rx and general claims).
4. Map each domain into FHIR resource structures.
5. Run unit tests and data quality checks.
6. Wrote enriched and transformed data to Parquet/CSV for Databricks.
7. Outline improvements and CI/CD considerations below 
   CI/CD & Testing
GitHub Actions workflow
I would add a file at .github/workflows/ci.yml immediately after the unit-tests section. In that YAML Iâ€™d install dependencies, run pytest, and fail the build on any test errors so regressions are caught on every push.
Prepare Output for Databricks
Partitioned Parquet layout
I would insert a markdown cell showing the directory pattern:
s3://<bucket>/ccda_output/
    year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/
        part-*.parquet
to ensure Databricks Auto Loader can ingest by partition.
Orchestration (Airflow DAG)
High-level Airflow DAG sketch
I would add a markdown cell with a diagram or pseudocode showing:
with DAG('ccda_pipeline'):
    t1 = DownloadCCDA(...)
    t2 = ParseMedicationsSpark(...)
    t3 = ParseProblemsSpark(...)
    t4 = TransformAndJoin(...)
    t5 = UploadToS3(...)
    t1 >> [t2, t3] >> t4 >> t5
Task-to-notebook mapping
I would insert a table like:
Task  Notebook / Script
download 1_download_ccda.ipynb
parse 2_parse_medications.ipynb
transform   3_transform_join.py
load  4_upload_s3.ipynb
Monitoring & Logging
   This can be done either by using AWS Cloudwatch for monitoring process like parsing and storing data inside S3 bucket
   Secondly,jobs can be monitored via monitoring DAG jobs and also Databricks jobs as well using tools or in house built processes.(env dependent)
